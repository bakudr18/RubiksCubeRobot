## Introduction
Rubik's Cube Robot can solve the rubik's cube around 90 seconds including detecting and solving. This project is made by 86duino, Maixduino, OV2640 camera, RS-1270 servo motors and ws2812 led strip. The mechanisms refer to [OTVINTA](http://www.rcr3d.com/intro.html) and all of them are 3d printable. The solving algorithm was implemented by [Muodov](https://github.com/muodov/kociemba). He also made a great cube solving machine [Meccano Rubik's Shrine](http://blog.zok.pw/hacking/2016/08/12/meccano-rubiks-shrine/).
